### Agent Joins a Queue

```json
{
  "payload": "queue-monitor",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T18:53:26.298Z",
  "items": {
    "Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1BFT1BMRS9a...": {
      "Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL0NBTExfUVVFVUUvNm...": "active"

  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T19:02:11.551Z",
  "items": {

      "Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL0NBTExfUVVFVUUvNT...": "inactive"
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple Agents in One Payload

If changes for multiple users happen simultaneously, they can appear in the same payload:

```json
{
  "payload": "queue-monitor",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T19:05:00.000Z",
  "items": {
    "<userId1>": {
      "<queueId>": "active"
    },
    "<userId2>": {
      "<queueId>": "inactive"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** If no changes are detected during a polling cycle, no webhook will be sent.
